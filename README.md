# [Projet 1: Factors Influencing Body and Antler Size Relationships in White-tailed Deer: Project Overview]()
* Analyzed the degree to which maternal attributes (i.e., litter type and mother's age) and dietary energy influence body:antler size scaling relationships in white-tailed deer.
* Analyzed these relationships at two levels: 1) through the entire lifespan of individuals, and 2) at 5 different age groups (i.e., 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5).
